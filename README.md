<h2> About this project: </h2>

This repository is my project for the [Professional Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/scikitlearn-ml/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description : </h2>

In this repository, we use several datasets. The implemented algorithms explore advanced Sklearn functionalities. Some of these include:

- PCA and IPCA
- Lasso and Ridge regressions for regularization sake
- Robust Regression
- Ensamble methods (bagging and boosting)
